# OC-ThinkPad-Yoga-12
OpenCore configs for Lenovo Thinkpad S1/Yoga 12
> Note that I included 2 EFIs, for USB I disabled secure boot and add a force kext injection to IO80211Family to make AirportItlwm works without Secure Boot. You can use the EFI for USB for your main drive EFI but I don't really recommend it because it will breaks compatibility in the future update.<br>
> Explanation can be found [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ktext.html#wifi-and-bluetooth) (navigate to "More info on enabling AirportItlwm")

Currently tested under macOS Catalina 10.15.7
<h3>My current specifications</h3>

- Processor: Intel Core i7-5500U (Broadwell)
- RAM: 8GB DDR3 (soldered)
- Storage: 128GB M.2 SATA SSD, 1TB SATA HDD
- Touchpad: Synaptics (VoodooRMI + VoodooSMBus kexts, VoodooPS2 kext is only for Keyboard)
- Audio: Conexant CX20751 ("layout-id=3" under DeviceProperties with AppleALC kext)
<h3>What's working?</h3>

- WiFi (with [AirportItlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases/))
> Since I'm running Catalina I picked up AirportItlwm for Catalina, if you're planning to install other than Catalina (e.g. Big Sur) please replace AirportItlwm.kext under /EFI/OC/Kexts with a designated macOS version.
- Bluetooth (with IntelBluetooth, <i>self explanatory</i>)
- Function keys (with ECEnabler and [YogaSMC](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC/releases/tag/1.5.1), SSDT patches already done in this EFI you just need to install YogaSMCPane/YogaSMCNC)
> Keyboard brightness stages can't be recognized. To fix Mute LED switch open System Prefs > YogaSMCPane > Think > LED Automation > MuteLEDFixup (check). I'm currently working on this.
- USB (mapped from Windows, <i>self explanatory why I do this in Windows lol</i> ðŸ˜œ)
- Brightness keys (with BrightnessKeys kext, <i>self explanatory</i>)
- Pen input (registered as mouse, but surprisingly there's no input lags.)
- Trackpoint (<i>yes it works lol</i>)
<h3>What's not working or partially working?</h3>

- SD card (some users went by using [Sinetek-rtsx](https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx) kext, but current reports that I found from several repos that the kext is quite unstable, and since I don't have an SD card to test and use I just completely forget about it.)
- Touchscreen (while it's detected under USB map, I can't make the touchscreen works. Tried VoodooI2C outputs the same thing so I just forget about it. And because I use pen input a lot I didn't miss the touchscreen anyway.)
- Sensors (this is currently untested as it appears under USB map, but so far there's no users reporting that sensors are working so I just forget about it.)
<h3>Untested</h3>

- HDMI (but I assume it's working fine)
- Docking station (I don't have one)
<h3>Small notes!</h3>

- Keep in mind that I'm currently still working on this! There will be a few updates coming on sooner or later!
- As always, please generate your own APECID, and PlatformInfo! For this particular device I use <b>MacBookPro12,1</b> following from this [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/broadwell.html#platforminfo)!
